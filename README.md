# chgnet

- chgnet is developped by Ceder & Berkeley Lawrence Livermore Lab for ionic materials

- https://chgnet.lbl.gov

- it has been extended to equivariant NN (which is basically spherical harmonics & Clebsch Gordan Coefficients)

https://github.com/AIforGreatGood/charge3net

the high value of the chgnet variants is to precompute relaxed structures and finally run one DFT computation to speed up DFT calculations
