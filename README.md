# chgnet

chgnet is developped by Ceder & Berkeley Lawrence Livermore Lab for ionic materials

it has been extended to equivariant NN (which is basically Clebsch Gordan Coefficients)

the high value of the chgnet variants is to precompute relaxed structures and finally run one DFT computation to speed up DFT calculations
